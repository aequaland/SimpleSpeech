        /*
            In the LocalizationTables window, you can see your StringTableCollection .asset (If you select it)(It's the same window for AssetTableCollection). 
            There, you can see the selected StringTableCollection on the "Selected Table Collection" field. 
            Each StringTableCollection has multiple StringTable for each Locale (language) you selected in the StringTableCollection.asset inspector. 
            If you don't see the option to add the StringTable with the desired language, you probably need to create a new StringTable.asset and assign it the Locale. 
            If you don't have that Locale, create it from LocalizationSettings.asset via his inspector in the LocaleGenerator button.
